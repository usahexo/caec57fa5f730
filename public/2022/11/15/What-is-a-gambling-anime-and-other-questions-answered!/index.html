<h1 id="The-5-best-gambling-anime-of-all-time"><a href="#The-5-best-gambling-anime-of-all-time" class="headerlink" title="The 5 best gambling anime of all time!"></a>The 5 best gambling anime of all time!</h1><p>Gambling anime are a rare breed. There are not many of them, and most of them are mediocre at best. However, there are a few that really stand out, and these are the five best gambling anime of all time.</p>
<ol>
<li>Kakegurui</li>
</ol>
<p>Kakegurui is one of the newer gambling anime, but it has quickly become one of the most popular ones. It is a psychological thriller that revolves around high school students who gamble for money and status. The characters are all incredibly complex, and the story is constantly keeping you on your toes. If you are looking for an intense gambling anime that will keep you hooked from beginning to end, then Kakegurui is definitely the one for you.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Akagi</li>
</ol>
<p>Akagi is a classic gambling anime that was first released in 2005. It tells the story of a talented young Mahjong player who gets pulled into the world of illegal gambling. The characters are all fascinating and the plot is full of twists and turns. If you enjoy intense Mahjong games with dramatic story lines, then Akagi is definitely worth watching.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Kaiji</li>
</ol>
<p>Kaiji is another classic gambling anime that deserves to be mentioned on this list. It follows the story of a poor young man who gets involved in an illegal debt repayment scheme. The games Kaiji takes part in are brutal and very risky, but he somehow manages to come out on top every time. If you love suspenseful tales full of drama and action, then Kaiji is definitely worth watching.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Gambler’s Ballad: Jiltoku no Suizokukan</li>
</ol>
<p>Gambler’s Ballad: Jiltoku no Suizokukan is a lesser-known gambling anime, but it is well worth watching if you can find it. It tells the story of a young woman who becomes obsessed with blackjack after her father loses everything playing the game. The story is full of heartbreak and betrayal, and the blackjack games are incredibly exciting to watch. If you are looking for an underrated gem, then Gambler’s Ballad: Jiltoku no Suizokukan is definitely worth checking out.</p>
<p>5 . Ouroboros</p>
<p>Ouroboros may not be as well known as some of the other entries on this list, but it deserves to be mentioned nonetheless. It tells the story of two detectives who team up to take down a powerful crime syndicate. The action sequences are brilliantly animated and the betrayal between the two main characters is heartbreaking to watch unfold. If you are looking for an exciting detective drama with plenty of gambling thrown in, then Ouroboros is definitely worth watching</p>
