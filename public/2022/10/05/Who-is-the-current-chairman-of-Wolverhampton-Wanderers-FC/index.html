<h1 id="How-many-times-have-Wolves-won-the-Football-League-Championship"><a href="#How-many-times-have-Wolves-won-the-Football-League-Championship" class="headerlink" title="How many times have Wolves won the Football League Championship?"></a>How many times have Wolves won the Football League Championship?</h1><p>The English Football League Championship (EFLC) is the second-highest division of English football, after the Premier League. The league was founded in 1888 as the Football League and consists of 72 teams split into three divisions: the Championship, League One, and League Two.</p>
<p>Wolves are a professional association football club based in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England. They compete in the EFL Championship, the second tier of English football. The club was founded in 1877 and played at several grounds before moving to their current home of Molineux Stadium in 1889. Wolves have won three Football League Championships, six FA Cups, four League Cups, two Charity Shields and one Intertoto Cup.</p>
<p>As of 2019, Wolves have won the EFL Championship on five occasions: 1954–55, 1971–72, 1977–78, 2007–08 and 2018–19. This makes them the fourth most successful club in the history of the EFL Championship.</p>
<h1 id="Who-are-the-most-successful-club-in-Wolves’-history"><a href="#Who-are-the-most-successful-club-in-Wolves’-history" class="headerlink" title="Who are the most successful club in Wolves’ history?"></a>Who are the most successful club in Wolves’ history?</h1><p>The most successful club in Wolves’ history are without doubt, the Liverpool F.C. They have won more trophies and achieved more success than any other club in Wolves’ history.</p>
<p>Liverpool F.C was founded in 1892 and soon became one of the most successful clubs in England, winning three league titles and two FA Cups by the turn of the century. They continued their success into the new millennium, winning another five league titles and four FA Cups.</p>
<p>Wolves have had a few decent runs in their time, but they have never come close to achieving the same level of success as Liverpool F.C. The closest they have ever come was when they finished second in the First Division (now Premier League) in 1980-1981.</p>
<p>Liverpool F.C are widely regarded as one of the biggest clubs in world football and their achievements reflect that. They are a record eight times winners of the European Cup/Champions League and have also won the UEFA Cup, UEFA Super Cup, FA Cup, League Cup, Community Shield and FIFA Club World Cup.</p>
