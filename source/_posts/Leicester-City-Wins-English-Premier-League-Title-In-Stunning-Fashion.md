#  Leicester City Wins English Premier League Title In Stunning Fashion

It was the biggest shock in English soccer history.

Last season, Leicester City, a team that had narrowly avoided relegation the year before, won seven of their last nine games to finish in 14th place in the 20-team Premier League. This season, they won their final 10 games to clinch the title with two games to spare—making them the first team ever to go from bottom to first in just one year.

It was an improbable journey, and it captivated fans around the world. Manager Claudio Ranieri, who had been fired by two other Premier League clubs, was given little chance of success when he took over at Leicester City in July 2015. But he instilled a team spirit and tactical discipline that turned Leicester into one of the most efficient sides in England.

The players also made history. Jamie Vardy, a 29-year-old striker who was playing in England’s third division four years ago, became the first player to score in 11 consecutive Premier League games. Riyad Mahrez, a 25-year-old Algerian winger, was named Player of the Season after scoring 17 goals and providing 11 assists.

But it was not only Leicester’s players who were making history; so too were their fans. For most of its 132-year existence, Leicester City had been a yo-yo club that spent more time outside England’s top division than inside it. But after their stunning title win, the club is now worth an estimated £325 million ($468 million), making it one of the most valuable teams in Europe.

#  The 5 Most Memorable Moments Of Leicester City's Historic Season

In the 2015/16 Premier League season, Leicester City pulled off one of the greatest upsets in sports history. The team, who were 5000-1 outsiders at the start of the season, went on to win the Premier League, beating teams like Manchester City, Chelsea, and Arsenal along the way.

Here are 5 of the most memorable moments from Leicester City's historic season:

1) Jamie Vardy's record-breaking goal streak.

In August 2015, Jamie Vardy scored in 11 consecutive Premier League games, breaking a 23-year-old record in the process. This was just one of many highlights for Vardy during Leicester City's title-winning season.

2) The Foxes' 5-3 victory over Manchester United.

This match was a real turning point for Leicester City's season. Up until this point, they had been struggling in the Premier League; but after this victory over Manchester United, they went on an incredible run that saw them win the league title.

3) Claudio Ranieri's 'Dilly-ding, dilly-dong' call to his players.

Leicester City manager Claudio Ranieri made a name for himself during the team's title-winning season with his unique motivational phrases. One of his most famous sayings was "Dilly-ding, dilly-dong", which he would use to get his players fired up before matches.

4) Jamie Vardy's last minute winner against Southampton.

This goal was perhaps the most important goal of Leicester City's championship-winning season. With just minutes remaining in the match and Southampton leading 2-0, Jamie Vardy scored a brilliant late goal to snatch a 3-2 victory for Leicester City. This goal kept their title hopes alive and ultimately led to their eventual championship victory.

5) The Foxes' post-title parade through Leicester city centre.

After winning the Premier League title, Leicester City had a post-title parade through Leicester city centre where thousands of supporters turned out to celebrate their amazing achievement. This parade was an unforgettable moment for both players and fans alike and will always be remembered as one of the highlights of Leicester City's history.

#  Claudio Ranieri: The Unsung Hero Behind Leicester City's Triumph

Claudio Ranieri was the mastermind behind Leicester City's improbable Premier League triumph in the 2015-16 season. The veteran Italian manager had been ridiculed by the media and fans alike for his archaic tactics and "lack of ambition" prior to Leicester's title win, but he proved all his detractors wrong with a brilliant coaching performance.

Ranieri's tactics were indeed old-school, but they were perfectly tailored to the strengths of his players. He relied on a strong defensive foundation, quick counter-attacks, and clinical finishing from Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez to nick points against the bigger clubs. The team's hard work and determination also won him plenty of admirers; these qualities were most evident in their dramatic late-season escape from relegation.

Leicester City's title win would not have been possible without Ranieri's superb coaching, nor would it have been as memorable without his charming personality. The 63-year-old manager has become a cult hero at Leicester, and he will be remembered as one of the greatest managers in Premier League history.

#  Jamie Vardy: The Boy Who Became A Premier League Legend

The story of Jamie Vardy is the ultimate rags-to-riches tale. He was born to a single mother in working class Sheffield and spent his childhood getting into trouble and bouncing around from job to job. At the age of 16, he was working in a factory producing medical supplies and making £40 per week.

Despite his difficult upbringing, Vardy never stopped dreaming of making it as a professional footballer. When he was 22, he was playing for non-league Fleetwood Town and living in a caravan. His big chance came in the summer of 2014 when Leicester City signed him for £1 million.

Vardy made an instant impact at Leicester, scoring in his first game for the club. He went on to score 24 goals in the Premier League during the 2015/16 season as Leicester shocked the world by winning the title.

His performances caught the eye of England manager Roy Hodgson, who selected him for Euro 2016. Vardy scored on his England debut against Wales and went on to score 3 goals at the tournament as England reached the semi-finals.

Now 31 years old, Jamie Vardy is a Premier League legend and one of the most successful English footballers of all time. His story is an inspiration to anyone who has ever been told they are not good enough.

#  How Leicester City's Fairytale Season Changed Football Forever

Leicester City Football Club was founded in 1884 by a group of friends who lived in the city. The club played its first match in October 1884 against Sheffield United, which they lost 2-1.

Leicester City rose to prominence in the early 1900s under the stewardship of local businessman James Willis Stewart, who became chairman and club president. The club reached the FA Cup final for the first time in their history in 1928, but were beaten 1-0 by Bolton Wanderers. Leicester won promotion to Division One in 1957, and reached the FA Cup semi-finals two years later, where they were again defeated by Bolton Wanderers.

The 1970s saw some inconsistent league performances from Leicester, with the club twice being relegated to Division Two and twice promoted back to Division One. In 1981, they were promoted to the top flight as Second Division champions. However, they were relegated back to Division Two after just one season.

In 1992-93, Leicester were promoted to the newly formed Premier League as First Division champions. They finished 14th in their first season in the Premier League and avoided relegation by one point. However, the club was then relegated at the end of the 1995-96 season after finishing second from bottom of the table.

Leicester returned to the Premier League after winning promotion from Football League Championship as champions in 2014. The Foxes had a remarkable campaign in 2015-16 that saw them crowned champions of England for the first time in their history. Claudio Ranieri's side began the season as 5,000/1 outsiders for the title but won their last 10 matches of the season to finish with 82 points – seven points clear of second placed Tottenham Hotspur. 

The title win was described as "the biggest sporting shock ever" and "an explosion of joy unconfined". Former Leicester striker Gary Lineker said: "I still can't believe it. It's staggering." Foxes midfielder Danny Drinkwater said: "It still feels like a dream." 

Leicester's fairytale season has changed football forever. No longer are clubs like Manchester United and Chelsea guaranteed success – now any team can win the Premier League if they play well enough over 38 matches. As Ranieri himself said: "It's opened my eyes a lot this year because it means something can happen if you believe." 

This is reflected in Leicester's attendance figures for this season; while their average home attendance for last season was 31,812 (ranking them 15th out of 20 teams), their average home attendance for this season is 32,565 (ranking them 11th out of 20 teams). This suggests that people are now more interested in watching Leicester than other Premier League teams, as they know that anything is possible with this team. 

 Leicester City's fairytale season has also paved the way for other smaller clubs to achieve success. In May 2016, Hull City became only the second team outside England's traditional top six clubs – after Leicester – to win promotion to the Premier League. And on 8 August 2016, Burton Albion became the first team from outside England's top two divisions to reach a major domestic cup final when they reachedthe EFL Cup final against Manchester City (a match which they ultimately lost 5-3 on penalties). 

So overall, Leicester City's fairy tale season has changed football forever by proving that any team can win the Premier League if they play well enough over 38 matches; it has pavedthe way for other smaller clubs to achieve success; and it has shown that people are now more interested in watching Leicester than other Premier League teams
