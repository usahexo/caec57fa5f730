#  Belarus Legalizes Online Gambling, After Effects Slot Machine Available to Play

Belarus, a former Soviet republic located in Eastern Europe, has legalized online gambling. This is following on from the legalization of land-based casino gambling in 2017. Slot machines are now available to play in many convenience stores across the country.

The government has been keen to tap into the potential tax revenue that online gambling can generate. Deputy Prime Minister Igor Petrishenko has previously stated that the legalization of online gambling could bring in up to $50 million per year in tax revenue. It is hoped that this will help to offset some of the impact of the economic sanctions that have been imposed on Belarus by the European Union and United States.

It is not yet clear how much revenue has been generated since the legalization of online gambling, but officials are optimistic that it will be a significant amount. The government has also announced plans to liberalize the licensing process for online casinos, which is expected to result in even more revenue being generated from this sector.

It is worth noting that there are still some restrictions on online gambling in Belarus. For example, players must be at least 21 years of age and only residents of Belarus are allowed to gamble online.

The legalization of online gambling in Belarus is likely to have an positive impact on the Belarusian economy. Not only will it bring in additional tax revenue, but it is also likely to create jobs in the growing gaming industry.
