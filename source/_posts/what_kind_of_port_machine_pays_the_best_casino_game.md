# What Kind of Slot Machine Pays the Best

Slot machines have been a staple in casinos for many years. They are easy to play and offer the chance to win big with just a small bet. However, with so many different types of slot machines available, it can be difficult to know which one to choose. One of the biggest questions that people have is which kind of slot machine pays the best. In this article, we will take a look at some of the different types of slot machines and which ones have the highest payout rates.

## Types of Slot Machines

Before we can determine which type of slot machine pays the best, it's important to understand the different types of slot machines that are available. Here are a few of the most common types of slot machines:

### Classic Slots

Classic slots, also known as three-reel slots, are the most basic type of slot machine. They typically have three reels and one payline. Classic slots usually have fewer features than other types of slot machines, but they can still be a lot of fun to play.

### Video Slots

Video slots are the most popular type of slot machine today. They have five or more reels and multiple paylines. Video slots often have bonus rounds and other special features that can increase your chances of winning.

### Progressive Slots

Progressive slots are a type of video slot that have a jackpot that increases over time. Each time a player makes a bet, a portion of that bet goes towards the jackpot. Progressive slots can offer huge payouts, but they are also harder to win.

### 3D Slots

3D slots are a newer type of slot machine that use advanced graphics and animations to create a more immersive gaming experience. They are similar to video slots but with more advanced graphics and animations.

## Which Slot Machine Pays the Best?

Now that we've looked at some of the different types of slot machines, let's take a look at which ones pay the best.

### Return to Player (RTP)

The first thing to consider when looking at the payout rates of slot machines is the Return to Player (RTP) percentage. This is the percentage of money that is returned to players over time. For example, if a slot machine has an RTP of 95%, it means that over time, the machine will pay out $0.95 for every $1 that is bet.

### High RTP Slots

The slot machines with the highest RTP percentages are generally the ones that pay the best. While it's not a guarantee that you will win big on these machines, it does mean that you will have a better chance of winning. Some of the slot machines with the highest RTP percentages include:

- Mega Joker - 99%
- Blood Suckers - 98%
- Starmania - 97.87%
- Rainbow Riches Pick 'n' Mix - 98%
- Devil's Delight - 97.6%

### Progressive Slots

While progressive slots can offer huge payouts, they are also harder to win. The odds of hitting the jackpot on a progressive slot machine are often very low, but the payout can be life-changing. Some of the most popular progressive slot machines include:

- Mega Moolah
- Mega Fortune
- Hall of Gods
- Arabian Nights
- Beach Life

### Video Slots

Video slots are the most popular type of slot machine today, and they can offer some of the highest payouts. Many video slots have multiple paylines and bonus rounds, which can increase your chances of winning big. Some popular video slot machines include:

- Gonzo's Quest
- Immortal Romance
- Thunderstruck II
- Game of Thrones
- Avalon II

## Conclusion

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of which slot machine pays the best.
