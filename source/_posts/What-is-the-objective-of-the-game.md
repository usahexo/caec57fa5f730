#  What is the objective of the game?

The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible. Points are scored by getting the ball into the opponent’s goal.

# How do players score points?

Players score points by getting the ball into the opponent’s goal. The ball can be passed between players or kicked into the goal.

# How is the game played?

The game is played on a rectangular field that is divided into two halves. Each team has ten players, of which six are positioned on the field and four are in reserve. The game begins with a throw-in, which is when the ball goes out of bounds and a player from the other team throws it back in. Players can only touch the ball with their hands if they are inside their own playing area. If a player steps out of bounds or handles the ball illegally, they will lose possession and their team will be punished with a free kick. The goalkeeper can use their hands to stop goals, but must release the ball once they have control of it again. A goal is scored when the ball goes completely over the goal line and between the posts.

# What are some common rules violations?

There are several common rules violations, such as handling the ball, stepping out of bounds, and playing dangerously. If a player breaks one of these rules, they will likely be given a yellow card (warning) or a red card (ejection from the game).

#  Who created it?

The history of the world wide web is a long and winding road that has been paved with many different contributions from many different people. However, there is one name that always seems to come up when discussing the origins of the web: Sir Tim Berners-Lee. Berners-Lee is widely considered to be the father of the world wide web, having invented it in 1989 while working at CERN.

# How did it start?

While working at CERN, Berners-Lee was looking for a way to make it easier for researchers at different locations to share information. At the time, there were a number of different systems for sharing information, but none of them were very efficient or user-friendly. Berners-Lee decided to create his own system, which he called the world wide web.

# What was its purpose?

The original purpose of the world wide web was to make it easier for researchers to share information. However, over time it has become much more than that. Today, the web is used by billions of people around the world to communicate, interact, and do business.

# How has it changed over time?

The world wide web has changed a lot over the years. In its early days, it was primarily used by academics and researchers. But as more and more people started using it, it began to evolve into something much bigger. Today, the web is used by billions of people for all sorts of purposes, from communicating with friends and family to doing business transactions.
