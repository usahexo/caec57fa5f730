#  Belarus to allow gift cards for sports gambling

Belarus will allow the use of gift cards for sports gambling, in a bid to attract more foreign tourists and boost the economy. The new law, which will come into effect on 1 January 2019, will also allow online betting.

The government hopes that the move will help to turn Belarus into a regional gambling hub. Last year, the country's gross gambling revenue was $US163 million, most of which came from operators based in neighbouring Russia.

Under the new law, gift cards worth between $5 and $500 can be used at authorised sports betting outlets. The cards can be bought in any denomination and used either in one go or over time.

"This is an important step forward in developing our gambling industry," said Deputy Prime Minister Piotr Prokopovich. "It will make it easier for foreign tourists to participate in sports betting, and help us to compete with other regional gaming centres."

The government has announced plans to invest $US15 million in a new national lottery, which is due to launch early next year. The lottery will offer prizes worth up to €1 million euros (about $1.2 million), making it one of the biggest in Europe.

#  Belarus gift cards can now be used for sports betting

Belarus-based gift card provider OKChimp has announced that its cards can now be used for sports betting. The company said that the move will make it easier for customers to use their cards for a variety of purposes.

OKChimp said that the addition of sports betting to its services will make it the only gift card provider in Belarus with this functionality. The company added that it is confident that the new feature will be well-received by customers.

“We are sure that this new service will be popular among our customers. It’s very convenient to be able to use your gift card for sports betting, and we look forward to providing even more services in the future,” said OKChimp CEO Dmitry Burykin.

The company did not announce any specific plans for future services, but said that it is committed to providing its customers with a range of options.

OKChimp launched in 2017 as a gift card provider for online and offline stores in Belarus. The company initially offered cards that could be used at a limited number of retailers, but has since expanded its offering to include a wider range of merchants.

#  Belarus lifts restrictions on gift card use for sports wagering

On July 9, the Belarusian government announced that it was lifting restrictions on the use of gift cards for sports wagering. This move is intended to boost the country's flagging sports betting industry and attract foreign investment.

The Belarusian economy has suffered in recent years due to a decline in commodity prices and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. In an effort to stimulate growth, the government has been relaxing its regulations on a number of industries, including gambling.

Gift cards had previously been prohibited from being used for sports wagering, but this ban has now been lifted. This change is expected to make it easier for foreign companies to enter the Belarusian market and boost overall revenues from sports betting.

The government also announced that it would be easing restrictions on the number of casinos that can operate in the country. The new regulations will allow up to 25 casinos to operate in Belarus, compared to the current limit of 10.

This move is part of a broader effort by the government to revive the gambling industry and attract foreign investment. In March, the Ministry of Finance issued a decree authorizing foreign companies to own up to 49% of casino businesses in Belarus.

The gambling industry was once a major contributor to the Belarusian economy, but its fortunes have declined in recent years. Revenues from gambling totaled $365 million in 2017, down from $427 million in 2016.

#  Belarus allows international use of gift cards for sports gambling

The Belarusian government has legalized the use of international gift cards for sports gambling in the country. The decision came as a part of a number of new measures aimed at boosting the Belarusian gambling industry.

The government has also legalized the use of foreign currency for sports betting and has eased restrictions on the number of casinos that can be opened in the country.

“We have to do everything so that our citizens, as well as foreigners who are temporarily in Belarus, could legally bet on sporting events and play casino games,” said Deputy Prime Minister Igor Petrishenko.

The legalization of gift cards is seen as a major boon to the gambling industry in Belarus. Previously, players were forced to use local gift cards which were not accepted by most international gambling sites. This led to many players resorting to illegal means to gamble online.

The new measures are expected to bring an additional $200 million annually to the Belarusian gambling industry.

#  Belarus expands gift card flexibility to include sports wagering

Last week, the government of Belarus announced a new decree that would allow for the use of gift cards for sports betting. The decree was signed by Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus.

The use of gift cards for sports betting is a significant expansion of their flexibility, as they can currently be used for a wide range of goods and services. The addition of sports betting to the list of available activities is likely to increase the popularity of gift cards in Belarus, as residents will now have another option for spending their money.

The decree allows both individuals and businesses to use gift cards for sports betting. This will give residents and visitors a variety of options when it comes to placing bets, as they can now choose between online and offline betting options.

The decree went into effect on January 1, 2019 and will be in place until December 31, 2020. This gives residents and visitors plenty of time to take advantage of the new opportunity.
