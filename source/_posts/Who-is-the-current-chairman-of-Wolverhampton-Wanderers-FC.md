The English Football League Championship (EFLC) is the second-highest division of English football, after the Premier League. The league was founded in 1888 as the Football League and consists of 72 teams split into three divisions: the Championship, League One, and League Two.

Wolves are a professional association football club based in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England. They compete in the EFL Championship, the second tier of English football. The club was founded in 1877 and played at several grounds before moving to their current home of Molineux Stadium in 1889. Wolves have won three Football League Championships, six FA Cups, four League Cups, two Charity Shields and one Intertoto Cup.

As of 2019, Wolves have won the EFL Championship on five occasions: 1954–55, 1971–72, 1977–78, 2007–08 and 2018–19. This makes them the fourth most successful club in the history of the EFL Championship.
